You can find me at <div class="myemail">`a.klinakis`</div>

You'll notice you can't select the email address, I'm afraid you'll have to type
it in. That's because I'd like to guard myself from email harvesters. Look at
the bright side though: Others use images instead! At least you can copy the
'difficult' part :)

## How I Did It <a name="how"></a>

By using the `:after` pseudoclass. Full code:

{% highlight css %}

.myemail{
	font-family: monospace;
	font-size: 1.3em;
}

.myemail:after{
	content: "@yahoo.com";
}
{% endhighlight %}

To use it I wrapped my address in a div, like so:
`<div class="myemail">a.klinakis</div>`. And there you go.
