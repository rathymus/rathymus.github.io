I read somewhere that someone used Bayesian analysis on Myspace profiles of
potential dates with some degree of success. Actually I didn't read it, I saw
it on a [Ted video](http://youtu.be/hqKafI7Amd8). At the time it was election
season at StackOverflow and all candidates promised to reduce the
[close queue](http://stackoverflow.com/review), standing at 9K pending issues
at the time of writing.
