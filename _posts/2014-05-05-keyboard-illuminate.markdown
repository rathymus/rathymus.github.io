I don't have a backlit keyboard and I'd really like one.
I'd also like that keyboard to be my current one, which
doesn't support backlighting.

Fortuately I have a mechanical keyboard which means I've
got some room under the keys to make any adjustments. Keep
in mind, dear reader, that I know almost nothing of
electronics so take everything I say with a pinch of salt.

## Option 1: Fancy Tesla stuff

You could wrap a coil around the core of the key, the bit
that fits around the switch. That would feed in a LED
hot-glued to the underside of the key, powered by a big
coil on the underside of the keyboard.

Problems:

* The keyboard might get in the way
* There are side-channel considerations

Of course it's not just two coils blasting electrons at
each other, there's a keyboard in the way. I'm not sure
how that would work, if at all.

Consideration #2, it may be possible to detect the
changes in the EM field around the keyboard and thus
deduce which key was pressed.


## Option 2: Thin Wires
