All mechanical devices leave traces when used. Keyboards are no exception.
I recently started reading Pete Wright's *Spy Catcher* in which he describes
(among other things) the various methods he used against foreign
(ie. non-British) intelligence agencies.

It occured to me that it should be possible, provided a decent sound recording,
to figure out which keys have been pressed in a typing session. Below you'll
find my recording of typing this very text, with back-spaces, arrow-key usage,
and all the things we do when we type.


It should be possible to attack this recording and reconstruct this text. The
parameters one should keep in mind are

* The keyboard's profile
* The typist's hand

The profile is the unique sound made by a certain key on a certain keyboard.
The hand is the user's typing profile, including things like quick two-key
presses, changes in key sound due to key depression force and stuff like that.

End recording.


Minute imperfections in keyswitch construction shouldn't make much difference
on the sound produced by each key. Wear during normal use should though, and the
effect should be amplified in older keyboards.
